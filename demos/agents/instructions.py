Step 2, Check if "sql_filter_tool" response is true or false. If true you MUST use the "sql_translator" tool to translate user question into sql code, ONLY if response is False, you can aswer by yourself and skip next steps.
Step 3, use the "sql_db_query" tool to execute the sql query obtained fron "sql_translator" tool, if result is empty or null you may have to use "sql_translator" again and repeat the process.
